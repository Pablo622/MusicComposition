set a x distance lock function so that  takes the distance between the last two elements  that were added and sets that
as the distance for subsequent elements abs(x[-1] - x[-2]) = distance_between_elements .
next element = elememnts[-1].xxpos + distance_between_elements, ypos.mouseclick)

spply distance lock to black and white notes


t##### make current vertical align apply to notes and ledger
